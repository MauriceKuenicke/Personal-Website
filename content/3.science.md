Although I have left the scientific field right after my Bachelor studies at the Technical University of Berlin, I still maintain a few connections to old teachers and professors. Most of my help is provided in form of software that I have written during and shortly after my time at University. Most notably the trajectory calculations for stars and the gravitational potential used in the A&A paper published by Schulreich et. al. ([Numerical studies on the link between radioisotopic signatures on Earth and the formation of the Local Bubble](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/12/aa47532-23/aa47532-23.html)).

I have also held a splinter-meeting talk for that specific topic at the annual meeting of the german astronomical society in 2020 ([Calculating stellar trajectories: A comparison between epicycles and numerical integrator in Galpy](https://ag2020.astronomische-gesellschaft.de/view_abstract.php?id=83)).


All other physics relevant work is mostly of private nature to satisfy my curiosity.
